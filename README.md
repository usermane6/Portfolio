# Portfolio Template

Today we will create a simple portfolio website where you can showcase your work throughout this semester. Here are the primary tasks:

1. You are provided with a simple `index.html` and `style.css` files in this repository with some sections to fill in. Your first task is to fill in the sections and placeholders, such as your image, link to your GitHub profile, projects, About Me section etc. 

2. Add at least 1 section in your portfolio that you would want a potential employer to see.

3. Modify the CSS values to customize the portfolio. 

4. We will demo everyone's website at the end of the lab.
